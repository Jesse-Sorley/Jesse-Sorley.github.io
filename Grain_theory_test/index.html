                         <p> 
                            We are a brewery and taproom located in downtown Abilene, where we focus on aroma-packed and flavor-driven beer. We take great pride in our meticulous commitment to quality here, but we don’t shy away from experimentation, funk, twists on tradition, and unique ingredients. Our high standards extend to an expertly curated wine list, remarkable coffee available from our in-house Coffee Bar, and a full Kitchen serving a locally and internationally inspired menu. We've placed all this and more into 5,000 thoughtfully designed square feet in the heart of the city we love.

                <p>
                        Matthew has a rich history in brewing that is driven by a strong passion to artfully create award-winning recipes.
                     Matthew, or “Rooster,” has collected over seventy brewing medals, which include three first place steins at the largest single site homebrewing competition in the United States.
                      Matthew, along with Jeramie, will head up brewing operations at Grain Theory and will develop recipes for production as well as assist in the scheduling of new beer releases. 
                      In addition, Matthew will oversee the Grain Theory barrel program to include bourbon barrel aged stouts and complex sour beers. 
                      As an unapologetic lover of all things hops, there is no doubt the Grain Theory beer list will include many hazy, west coast, and double dry hopped IPAs.

                    David began homebrewing in 2010 and was immediately obsessed with the intricacies of brewing, eventually leading as president of the local homebrewing club and collecting several awards along the way, including a gold for his Munich Helles at the largest single site homebrew competition in the country. He is meticulous and precise to a downright nerdy degree, which works out great for us since he heads up all our business operations. His nerdiness extends to good coffee, tea, and all things foodie related. After years involved in ministry and business, he is following his passion and living out a dream by creating an exciting gathering space in Abilene for innovative and creative brewing. As a native of South Africa, you will notice his international influence on the Grain Theory menu...and the rugby, cricket or F1 showing up on our big screen.

                Jeramie is Grain Theory's Swiss Army Knife. He brews, fixes, designs, improves, builds, has a degree in video and film production, and once met Busta Rhymes and Will Ferrell in the same day (true story). He brings his previous pro brewing experience from creating and overseeing a successful brand/brewery for a multi-location restaurant and serving as head-brewer for the brand which still operates throughout Texas, Arkansas, and Missouri. Jeramie is a man who LOVES his career. If he's not brewing your beer right now, he's probably talking or reading about beer, attending a brewing seminar, researching a new fermentation enzyme, or, more than likely, developing some wild idea for a new beer. You might call him obsessed, but we just call him our brewer. He never stops dreaming up ways to expand our eclectic taplist and to push the boundaries of his craft. He and Matthew make a perfect brewhouse team and continue to play to their respective strengths in creating the unrivaled quality and creativity you expect from Grain Theory.
